								<h2>The Beginning (6/7/2024)</h2>
								<p><b>The Premise</b></p>
								<p>Hello and welcome! I’m Ethan Alvi, a computer science student at Full Sail University with two other students, Saul Gerda, and Steven Alexander. Our school has challenged us to plan, develop, and ship a software application in the span of 5 months. We get to decide together on what application to make and how we’ll go about doing it. And the purpose of this blog is to display the whole process! I’ll talk about the ups and downs, the challenges, and the triumphs as we go on our journey to develop our app. </p>
								<p>Some reasons I'm excited to build this app include: 1. I get experience in app development. 2. I get to make something people can actually use. 3. I get another project for my portfolio. There's many ways this project can fail, but luckily, we have an instructor, Rebecca Carroll, to help us succeed with this undertaking. She oversees the project, provides resources, and gives us deadlines to help keep us on track for our 5-month goal. She pretty much acts like a producer for our team. With her help, I believe we can make a successful app.</p>
								<p><b>The App</b></p>
								<p>The first step is to decide what we’ll be making. After some deliberation, our team decided to make a shopping budgeting app called Budgie. It keeps track of the price of all the items in your shopping cart so you know if you’re over budget before you checkout. We liked this idea because we knew it would be useful for people like us. The thought of making something we would actually use really pushed us forward with this idea. We pitched it to our instructor and got the green light, so this will officially be our project! If you’re interested,
									 you can see our pitch presentation slides <a href="assets/Budgie_Pitch.pdf" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
								<p><b>What's Next</b></p>
								<p>So now, we’ll design the app and research the technologies we need to make it. I will share our progress here on my blog weekly until we finally ship our app! I’m excited to work on this project. Stay tuned to see what's next!</p>

								<p><b>Designing the App</b></p>
								<p>We are making great progress! This week, we created a Design Document and Style Tile describing every design detail and feature we plan to make (except for the specific layouts we'll get down next week). I believe it's a good idea to really nail down the design details in the beginning to make sure we know what we're making. Our teamwork has been good so far; everyone is volunteering to take on tasks, and the work is being split evenly. We each get along well, and I think we'll make a great team! You can see our current version of the Design Document <a href="assets/Budgie Design Document.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and below is our Style Tile.</p>

								<p><b>Problem: Differing Visions for the App</b></p>
								<p>One problem we faced this week was that we had a slightly different vision for the app. We had assumed we were all on the same page during our discussions, but in reality, we discovered we were each thinking of different features and menu systems for the app. Some of us weren't so attached to our original ideas and easily adopted new ones, but others were a little more attached. To be fair, I was one of those people, especially because I like to optimize everything, and it's hard to go with something that feels less so.</p>
								<p><b>Solution: Listen and Communicate</b></p>
								<p>Luckily enough, we were able to come to a solution. I knew we needed to be unified and come to a consensus on what we wanted. So I addressed it as soon as something came up. We simply talked to each other about it and managed to come to a general consensus. It never turned into a big argument. As I think back on our conversations, I can pick out some key principles that were in play that helped to resolve our conflicts successfully:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Listen to what the others had to say. Be humble enough to admit the possibility that someone else's idea might be better for the project. </li>
									<li>Communicate your goals for the app and why you wanted your idea. Be open and honest, as not everyone might know where you're coming from.</li>
									<li>Decide what is better together, and be objective about it. Be willing to put aside your own preferences for the preferences of your user base (the app is for them, not just you). </li>
								</ol>
								<p>Communicate your personal goals for the app. Try to come to an understanding. Align your goals and join forces. I believe many conflicts can be resolved this way. For us, we decided we needed to let users test the app first before we could say which idea was better for the users. It’s hard to predict what the users will do before you see them in action. In the end, I'm glad we could resolve our conflicts quite nicely, and I hope to continue to resolve our disputes this way.

								<p><b>Problem: Is This Feature Too Ambitious?</b></p>
								<p>One of the main features of Budgie, our app, is that you can take a picture of a price label at the store and it will automatically fill in the price of the item for you. To make this work, we will need an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) library, which performs the complicated work of programmatically making out the numbers and characters shown in the picture. There are a good number of available OCR libraries out there, but I was really interested in making my own. Our producer liked the idea but wanted to know if it was too out of scope for our 5-month development period. I honestly couldn’t answer that question. Apart from some experience with machine learning, I had no idea how to make an OCR. This leads to my problem: how could I know if making an OCR would be too difficult?								</p>
								<p><b>Solution: Research and Ask Experienced Developers</b></p>

									<figcaption style="font-size:75%">Brandon Patterson (LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-patterson-7038813/" target="_blank">here</a>)</figcaption>
								</figure>
								
								<p>One way to find out was to talk to someone who knows what it’s like to make an OCR. I decided to email my machine learning professor, Brandon Patterson, about what he thought since he has experience on the subject and knows my current level of knowledge. While I waited for his reply, I did some online research to find out what it would take. I found a helpful post on Quora about someone describing how he made an OCR from scratch. He said it took him “almost 2-3 days of consistent efforts and research” to make it, with regular updates (Atharva Hudlikar, <a href="https://qr.ae/pszcMT" target="_blank">https://qr.ae/pszcMT</a>). Another individual posted that they had worked on theirs “for several years” to make it efficient (Loic Aigon, <a href="https://qr.ae/pszcgj" target="_blank">https://qr.ae/pszcgj</a>). By then, Brandon emailed back and said the hardest part would be the image processing, which he wasn’t familiar with so he couldn’t say how difficult it’d be. </p>
								<p>I decided I would have to get more familiar with the process of developing an OCR to actually make a decision. As I researched online, I realized that how-to tutorials helped me the most because I could visualize in code what the process would look like. </p>
								<p>After a few hours of research, I felt confident that I could make an OCR in the time frame, just not from scratch. I told my producer that there are plenty of helpful libraries I can use that will still allow me to fine-tune the OCR for our app, like OpenCV and ML.NET. And of course, if it turns out that making an OCR is too much after all, then we can always use an existing one. I’m glad I did this research because it has only made me more excited to start developing this app!</p>

								<p><b>Problem: Not Communicating Effectively</b></p>
								<p>Our team is doing well, although one issue has come up: communication. The main thing is that I knew Saul well, and I knew Steven well, but Saul and Steven don’t know each other well. So, knowing they were more comfortable sharing their ideas with me, I started acting like the team’s communications facilitator: I would sometimes talk one on one with them about the project and get everyone’s ideas out that way. I talked with Steven about some issues with the UI, and he had some good ideas, and we came to a consensus on what we wanted. Later, I talked to Saul about the solution, but he had something else in mind that he wanted to try instead. There are a million different ways to do UI, and I wasn't married to our solution, so I was totally fine changing it. </p>
								<p>We decided to move forward with the new idea, but then I forgot to tell Steven about it the next time I saw him, so when the issue came up in conversation, they were both under the impression that the other was going off script. Not only that, but they were both passionate about their ideas, which only amplified the conflict. This happened with a few topics just this past week. This, along with some other factors, led to the two having some very heated discussions. I explained my part of the story, and that it was partly my fault, which helped a little bit, but still didn’t resolve the conflict. I was determined to make things better, so I wracked my 
									brain on how to approach this issue.
									</p>
								<p><b>Solution: Become a Better Team Member</b></p>
								<p>I had thought about the issue over the next few days, and I honestly didn’t know how to improve the team’s relationship. There were still some project concerns we had to resolve, and in my head, it seemed like a balancing act to do that while avoiding any arguments. The next time we all met, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the two team members used much more considerate language with each other this time and were able to work out most of the issues. This was a huge relief, and to be honest, made me realize I was inflating the problem a bit in my head, and I wasn’t giving them as much credit as they deserved. They learned to communicate and work with each other.
								</p>
								<p>And that’s the lesson I learned from all this. You could say that I could’ve prevented this if I kept everyone in the loop, which is true, but mistakes are bound to happen eventually with that team communication dynamic. While I wanted to make things easier for the team, I shouldn’t have tried to be the messenger boy for communicating ideas for the project. The better way is to raise the team up to a place where we can all communicate, and that could mean there's some conflict on the way there. But the place we reach is definitely worth it. I believe we all can learn to become better team members, and I believe this project is a great opportunity to do so.

								<h2>Choosing the Right Tool (7/8/2024)</h2>
								<p><b>Problem: What AI Framework is Best?</b></p>
								<p>This week, it was time for me to research how exactly to make our OCR. I had initially chosen to use ML.NET instead of the typical Python because I wanted to learn something new and it’s under the .NET framework, which is what we’re using to develop our app (.NET MAUI). However, as I started my research, some things made me reconsider that. First, ML.NET does not support neural networks natively; I would have to import a pretrained model and fine-tune it with my specific data. This is not terrible, but I was hoping to build my own neural network to learn more about how it works. Second, ML.NET will have trouble running models on Android because of processing constraints. To fix this, I would have to run a server to host my model and access it via HTTP request. These things don’t make using ML.NET impossible, but, are the benefits of using ML.NET worth the costs? Is there another language that’s more suited for our project?</p>
								<p><b>Solution: Research With a Focus on Our Project Needs</b></p>
								
								<p>This was a hard question to answer because I didn’t know the pros and cons of the other programming languages, neither did I know what other options I had. To fix that, I did some online research. According to some articles I found, there are plenty of options, including C++, Java, Javascript, and Go. Julia stuck out to me because it “offers near C-level performance” while keeping a simple syntax. Python also stuck out as an option because of its “ease of learning and use” and “robust community support.” (anurag702, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-language-for-machine-learning/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-language-for-machine-learning/</a>).
								</p>
								<p>While it’d be fun to learn a new language, I think Python will be the best fit for this project. After looking for code examples, I found that Julia had few results and little documentation on the subject. As beginners in deep learning, it’s important to have good documentation and online support to learn and to troubleshoot our code. That’s why I ultimately chose Python for our project. It was also a good decision because we ended up switching from .NET MAUI to Android Studio anyway, which suits Python well. I’m glad we figured this out now rather than in the middle of development!
