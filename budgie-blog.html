								<h2>The Beginning (6/7/2024)</h2>
								<p><b>The Premise</b></p>
								<p>Hello and welcome! I’m Ethan Alvi, a computer science student at Full Sail University with two other students, Saul Gerda, and Steven Alexander. Our school has challenged us to plan, develop, and ship a software application in the span of 5 months. We get to decide together on what application to make and how we’ll go about doing it. And the purpose of this blog is to display the whole process! I’ll talk about the ups and downs, the challenges, and the triumphs as we go on our journey to develop our app. </p>
								<p>Some reasons I'm excited to build this app include: 1. I get experience in app development. 2. I get to make something people can actually use. 3. I get another project for my portfolio. There's many ways this project can fail, but luckily, we have an instructor, Rebecca Carroll, to help us succeed with this undertaking. She oversees the project, provides resources, and gives us deadlines to help keep us on track for our 5-month goal. She pretty much acts like a producer for our team. With her help, I believe we can make a successful app.</p>
								<p><b>The App</b></p>
								<p>The first step is to decide what we’ll be making. After some deliberation, our team decided to make a shopping budgeting app called Budgie. It keeps track of the price of all the items in your shopping cart so you know if you’re over budget before you checkout. We liked this idea because we knew it would be useful for people like us. The thought of making something we would actually use really pushed us forward with this idea. We pitched it to our instructor and got the green light, so this will officially be our project! If you’re interested,
									 you can see our pitch presentation slides <a href="assets/Budgie_Pitch.pdf" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
								<p><b>What's Next</b></p>
								<p>So now, we’ll design the app and research the technologies we need to make it. I will share our progress here on my blog weekly until we finally ship our app! I’m excited to work on this project. Stay tuned to see what's next!</p>

								<p><b>Designing the App</b></p>
								<p>We are making great progress! This week, we created a Design Document and Style Tile describing every design detail and feature we plan to make (except for the specific layouts we'll get down next week). I believe it's a good idea to really nail down the design details in the beginning to make sure we know what we're making. Our teamwork has been good so far; everyone is volunteering to take on tasks, and the work is being split evenly. We each get along well, and I think we'll make a great team! You can see our current version of the Design Document <a href="assets/Budgie Design Document.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and below is our Style Tile.</p>

								<p><b>Problem: Differing Visions for the App</b></p>
								<p>One problem we faced this week was that we had a slightly different vision for the app. We had assumed we were all on the same page during our discussions, but in reality, we discovered we were each thinking of different features and menu systems for the app. Some of us weren't so attached to our original ideas and easily adopted new ones, but others were a little more attached. To be fair, I was one of those people, especially because I like to optimize everything, and it's hard to go with something that feels less so.</p>
								<p><b>Solution: Listen and Communicate</b></p>
								<p>Luckily enough, we were able to come to a solution. I knew we needed to be unified and come to a consensus on what we wanted. So I addressed it as soon as something came up. We simply talked to each other about it and managed to come to a general consensus. It never turned into a big argument. As I think back on our conversations, I can pick out some key principles that were in play that helped to resolve our conflicts successfully:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Listen to what the others had to say. Be humble enough to admit the possibility that someone else's idea might be better for the project. </li>
									<li>Communicate your goals for the app and why you wanted your idea. Be open and honest, as not everyone might know where you're coming from.</li>
									<li>Decide what is better together, and be objective about it. Be willing to put aside your own preferences for the preferences of your user base (the app is for them, not just you). </li>
								</ol>
								<p>Communicate your personal goals for the app. Try to come to an understanding. Align your goals and join forces. I believe many conflicts can be resolved this way. For us, we decided we needed to let users test the app first before we could say which idea was better for the users. It’s hard to predict what the users will do before you see them in action. In the end, I'm glad we could resolve our conflicts quite nicely, and I hope to continue to resolve our disputes this way.
